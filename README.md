# SIH — Sih.gov.in UI/UX Replica

**Live demo:** https://arpitgovil.github.io/SIH/  
**Repository:** https://github.com/arpitgovil/SIH

## Project overview
This project is a UI/UX replica of the Sih.gov.in
The goal is to reproduce the public-facing layout, components, and visual styling as a static/interactive frontend project for demonstration and learning.

## Features
- Static / interactive frontend replicating the Sih.gov.in UI/UX
- Responsive layout (desktop-first design adapted for smaller viewports)
- Reusable components and modular source structure (TypeScript + CSS)
- Live demo hosted via GitHub Pages

## Tech stack
- TypeScript
- Vite (development server & bundling)
- CSS (project styles)
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Getting started (development)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arpitgovil/SIH.git
   cd SIH
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The output directory is configured by the project (check `vite.config.ts` / `package.json` for exact output path).
